# FizzBuzz

The FizzBuzz problem is a classic test. The task is simple: Print integers 1 to N, but print “Fizz” if an integer is divisible by 3, “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by 5, and “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5. 

The FizzBuzz problem was solved using Jest for testing(TDD) and JavaScript.
